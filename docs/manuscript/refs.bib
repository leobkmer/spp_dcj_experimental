abstract="One of the most fundamental problems in genome rearrangement studies is the (genomic) distance problem. It is typically formulated as finding the minimum number of rearrangements under a model that are needed to transform one genome into the other. A powerful multi-chromosomal model is the Double Cut and Join (DCJ) model.While the DCJ model is not able to deal with some situations that occur in practice, like duplicated or lost regions, it was extended over time to handle these cases. First, it was extended to the DCJ-indel model, solving the issue of lost markers. Later ILP-solutions for so called natural genomes, in which each genomic region may occur an arbitrary number of times, were developed, enabling in theory to solve the distance problem for any pair of genomes. However, some theoretical and practical issues remained unsolved. On the theoretical side of things, there exist two disparate views of the DCJ-indel model, motivated in the same way, but with different conceptualizations that could not be reconciled so far. On the practical side, while ILP solutions for natural genomes typically perform well on telomere to telomere resolved genomes, they have been shown in recent years to quickly loose performance on genomes with a large number of contigs or linear chromosomes. This has been linked to a particular technique, namely capping. Simply put, capping circularizes linear chromosomes by concatenating them during solving time, increasing the solution space of the ILP superexponentially. Recently, we introduced a new conceptualization of the DCJ-indel model within the context of another rearrangement problem. In this manuscript, we will apply this new conceptualization to the distance problem. In doing this, we uncover the relation between the disparate conceptualizations of the DCJ-indel model. We are also able to derive an ILP solution to the distance problem that does not rely on capping. This solution significantly improves upon the performance of previous solutions on genomes with high numbers of contigs while still solving the problem exactly and being competitive in performance otherwise. We demonstrate the performance advantage on simulated genomes as well as showing its practical usefulness in an analysis of 11 Drosophila genomes.",

    abstract = { The Small Parsimony Problem (SPP) aims at finding the gene orders at internal nodes of a given phylogenetic tree such that the overall genome rearrangement distance along the tree branches is minimized. This problem is intractable in most genome rearrangement models, especially when gene duplication and loss are considered. In this work, we describe an Integer Linear Program algorithm to solve the SPP for natural genomes, i.e. genomes that contain conserved, unique, and duplicated markers. The evolutionary model that we consider is the DCJ-indel model that includes the Double-Cut and Join rearrangement operation and the insertion and deletion of genome segments. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated data and show that it is able to reconstruct very efficiently and accurately ancestral gene orders in a very comprehensive evolutionary model. }

    abstract = { The computation of genomic distances has been a very active field of computational comparative genomics over the past 25 years. Substantial results include the polynomial-time computability of the inversion distance by Hannenhalli and Pevzner in 1995 and the introduction of the double cut and join distance by Yancopoulos et al. in 2005. Both results, however, rely on the assumption that the genomes under comparison contain the same set of unique markers (syntenic genomic regions, sometimes also referred to as genes). In 2015, Shao et al. relax this condition by allowing for duplicate markers in the analysis. This generalized version of the genomic distance problem is NP-hard, and they give an integer linear programming (ILP) solution that is efficient enough to be applied to real-world datasets. A restriction of their approach is that it can be applied only to balanced genomes that have equal numbers of duplicates of any marker. Therefore, it still needs a delicate preprocessing of the input data in which excessive copies of unbalanced markers have to be removed. In this article, we present an algorithm solving the genomic distance problem for natural genomes, in which any marker may occur an arbitrary number of times. Our method is based on a new graph data structure, the multi-relational diagram, that allows an elegant extension of the ILP by Shao et al. to count runs of markers that are under- or over-represented in one genome with respect to the other and need to be inserted or deleted, respectively. With this extension, previous restrictions on the genome configurations are lifted, for the first time enabling an uncompromising rearrangement analysis. Any marker sequence can directly be used for the distance calculation. The evaluation of our approach shows that it can be used to analyze genomes with up to a few 10,000 markers, which we demonstrate on simulated and real data. }

    abstract = { Abstract Computing the edit distance between two genomes is a basic problem in the study of genome evolution. The double-cut-and-join (DCJ) model has formed the basis for most algorithmic research on rearrangements over the last few years. The edit distance under the DCJ model can be computed in linear time for genomes without duplicate genes, while the problem becomes NP-hard in the presence of duplicate genes. In this article, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to compute the DCJ distance between two genomes with duplicate genes. We also provide an efficient preprocessing approach to simplify the ILP formulation while preserving optimality. Comparison on simulated genomes demonstrates that our method outperforms MSOAR in computing the edit distance, especially when the genomes contain long duplicated segments. We also apply our method to assign orthologous gene pairs among human, mouse, and rat genomes, where once again our method outperforms MSOAR. }
